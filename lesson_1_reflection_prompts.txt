How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We could clearly see what new code was added..and since the project was working earlier
The bug ought to have come from the new code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see your previous versions and how your application evolved, and can go back if necessary

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic Save: pros- you never lose a data or change if you forget to commit
			cons- I don't really want to see that many versions, just the important ones


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think they allow multiple files because multiple files make a project. And we're saving the entire project as a whole

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log would have the entries of all the changes we made, and diff is comparing between two files or versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
