What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we intialize we sort of create a history panel, in the .git file, which allows us to store versions of the projects in the form of commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a mid way between both. It is so that after making a lot of changes , I may not want to save them in one commit but make two or three commits out of it. So I add the portion that I want in my first commit, and then make the commit, and then do the rest. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
As mentioned above

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Okay,  branches are basically when we want our project to move in two separate directions, and then keep developing it further in those directions. For e.g. probably I want a website to also be elder friendly, so I will make a branch and keep updating on that branch. And maybe when I also want to use the new features of master, I can update my file with that of master.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams reallyyy help as we can easily see the flow,

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
Because we are taking a branch (the check-out branch) and adding to it all the features of the other branch 

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
Well automatic merging is easier
But manual one gives you more control
